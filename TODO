## TODO 5/24/2017

* If there are no section headers then make sure to use dynamic segment to setup
* symtab and other items (.i.e plt/got)

* We should be able to load any file that the kernel can load, and reconstruct
* finer-grained meta data such as sections
based on techniques we used in ECFS, etc.

## FINISHED - * elf_plt_by_name()

## FINISHED - * Write a tool for printing the PLT entries for every JUMP_SLOT
symbol

## FINISHED - * elf_plt_iterator_next prints "PLT-0" as its final (extra)
iteration.

* userland execve based debugging (userland ptrace) with breakpoint, peek, poke,
* continue, attach, etc. (20% complete)

* Add in mpx instrumentation functions for quickly enabling mpx on target
 binaries. Which is essentially a set of functions to form a binary
 instrumentation based
 security tool
