# libelfmaster

## Secure ELF parsing library

libelfmaster is a C library for loading and parsing ELF objects
of any type. The goal of this project was to create an API that
is innovative in its ability to be user-friendly, secure, and
provide a variety of creative and useful ways to access an ELF
object. Not only that, but this library was largley created for
designing reverse engineering applications. This library is capable
of loading binaries with corrupted section headers and it will forensically
reconstruct section headers and symbol tables using state-of-the-art
techniques, such as PT_GNU_EH_FRAME reconstruction for .symtab functions.
This library is also capable of seamlessly loading both 32bit and 64bit
ELF objects, vs. having to compile  two seperate libs for each
architecture. The downfall obviously being that this won't compile on
32bit machines.

## Current status

Work in progress. Not fully fuzzed or tested.

## API Documentation

The best documentation is to read the code in libelfmaster/examples.
elfparse.c is a simple version of readelf, but does not utilize every
API function so make sure to look at all examples.

```
bool elf_open_object(const char *path, elfobj_t *obj,
    elf_error_t *error);
```

Open an ELF object, and fill in the `elfobj_t` descriptor which is
then passed to all subsequent API functions.

`const char *path` is the path to the ELF object

`elfobj_t *obj` is a pointer to the ELF descriptor that will be filled in upon successful
return.

`elf_error_t *error` is filled in with the proper error code and message string upon failure.

*RETURN*

Function returns true on success, and false on failure. `elf_error_t *error` points to the error
information that is filled in upon failure.

*EXAMPLE:*

```
if (elf_open_object("/bin/ls", &obj, false, &err) == false) {
	fprintf(stderr, "failed: %s\n", elf_error_msg(&err));
	return -1;
}
```
